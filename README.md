Hi, I’m Muhammad Asri Alfajri, and I’m a student at Politeknik Negeri Batam. I'm really into Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Data Analysis. To deepen my understanding and skills in these fields, I’ve been actively participating in the Kampus Merdeka program.

I've had the opportunity to join MSIB Batch 5 at StartupCampus, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence Computer Vision. As a part of my final assignment, my team, The Explorers, developed 'Guardian Eyes,' an object detection system designed to identify dangerous objects in public spaces. Then, in MSIB Batch 6 at GreatEdu, I delved into Data Science through a bootcamp, and one of my projects involved predicting CO2 emissions in Rwanda (Judul Proyek: Prediksi Emisi CO2 di Rwanda). This project aimed to develop a machine learning model that could forecast weekly CO2 levels in various locations across the country.

Most recently, I’ve been exploring Advanced Artificial Intelligence in MSIB Batch 7 at InfiniteLearning. To further validate my knowledge and skills, I’ve also earned the Certified Associate Data Scientist (C.ADS) certification from BNSP. I'm excited to continue learning and applying these skills in the future.
