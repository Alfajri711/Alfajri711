## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Asri Alfajri, and Iâ€™m a student at Politeknik Negeri Batam. I'm really into Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Data Analysis. To deepen my understanding and skills in these fields, Iâ€™ve been actively participating in the Kampus Merdeka program.

I've had the opportunity to join MSIB Batch 5 at StartupCampus, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence Computer Vision. As a part of my final assignment, my team, The Explorers, developed 'Guardian Eyes,' an object detection system designed to identify dangerous objects in public spaces. Then, in MSIB Batch 6 at GreatEdu, I delved into Data Science through a bootcamp, and one of my projects involved predicting CO2 emissions in Rwanda (Judul Proyek: Prediksi Emisi CO2 di Rwanda). This project aimed to develop a machine learning model that could forecast weekly CO2 levels in various locations across the country.

Most recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring Advanced Artificial Intelligence in MSIB Batch 7 at InfiniteLearning. To further validate my knowledge and skills, Iâ€™ve also earned the Certified Associate Data Scientist (C.ADS) certification from BNSP. I'm excited to continue learning and applying these skills in the future.
